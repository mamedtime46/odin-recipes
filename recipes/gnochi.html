    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>This <em>homemade gnocchi</em> is easy to make with potatoes, flour, eggs, and salt. It's soft, pillowy, and
        light. Serve it with your favorite sauce for a delicious Italian meal!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds russet potatoes, 3 to 4 medium-large</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled plus more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees farenheit</li>
        <li>Use a fork to poke holes in the potatoes. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until
            tender when pierced with a fork.</li>
        <li>When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, but still warm, peel off and discard the skins. Pass the peeled
            potatoes through a ricer, or place them in a large bowl and mash with a fork until smooth</li>
        <li>Transfer the potatoes to a lightly floured surface and form them into a wide, thin mound. Drizzle with the
            egg and sprinkle with the salt and a third of the flour. Use your hands or a bench scraper to lift and fold
            the potatoes into themselves to incorporate the egg and flour.</li>
        <li>When the first addition of flour is just incorporated, sprinkle the potatoes with another third of the
            flour. Fold and lightly knead the dough to incorporate it. Continue adding flour a little at time and
            kneading and folding the dough until it’s soft and pillowy, but not sticky. You may not need all the flour,
            or you might need a bit more. Knead the dough as little as possible to incorporate the flour. You don’t want
            to overwork it.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a ball and cut it into 8 equal pieces. Dust your work surface and your hands with more
            flour and roll one piece into a rope about 1-inch in diameter. Cut it into ¾-inch pieces and transfer them
            to a floured plate or baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Optional step: Shape the gnocchi. Dip the tines of a fork in flour and hold the fork parallel to your work
            surface. Place one gnocco at the end of the tines and use one finger to press it into and along them. One
            side will have ridges and the other side will have an indentation from your finger. Repeat with the
            remaining gnocchi.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Set a colander over a large bowl nearby. Add a third of the
            gnocchi to the boiling water and cook for about 2 minutes, or until they float. Use a slotted spoon to lift
            the gnocchi out of the boiling water and into the colander, then repeat twice with the remaining gnocchi.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with marinara sauce or pesto, or try another of the serving suggestions in the blog post above.</li>
