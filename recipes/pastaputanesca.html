    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>This pasta puttanesca recipe is my take on the classic Italian dish, featuring a flavorful tomato sauce packed
        with garlic, capers, and olives. Perfect for weeknights, it comes together in under 30 minutes with simple
        pantry ingredients!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped (1/3 cup)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>12 ounces spaghetti pasta</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, plus more garnish, if desired</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the tomatoes in a large bowl and use your hands to crush them. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and salt and cook, stirring
            occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic, red pepper flakes, capers, and olives
            and sizzle, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes and cook for 8 to 10 minutes to develop the flavors.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare the spaghetti according to
            the package instructions, cooking until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the starchy pasta water, then drain the
            pasta.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta and Â½ cup of the reserved pasta water to the skillet with the tomato mixture. Cook, tossing,
            for 1 to 2 minutes over low heat, adding more pasta water as needed to coat the pasta in a light sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the parsley and toss to incorporate. Season to taste and serve topped with more parsley, if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
